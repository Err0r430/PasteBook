# PasteBook 
An easy on the eyes, portable, fun paste bin written in Svelte and Kotlin.

### Prerequisites
Docker. Both the frontend and backend are to be installed with Docker. You can learn more [here](https://www.docker.com).

## Automated Installation
This script will download and install all the files necessary to run PasteBook, as well as guide you through setting up SSL.
```bash
bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Loudbooks/PasteBook/refs/heads/master/install.sh)
```

> [!CAUTION]
> Do not modify `docker-compose.yml`. You will break things.

Once the script has completed, you can start PasteBook with the following command.
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## Manual Installation
The following is a guide to get PasteBook running on your system under your domain with SSL. All of this was tested on Ubuntu Linux.

### Preparation
Download `docker-compose.yml` [here](https://github.com/Loudbooks/PasteBook/blob/master/docker-compose.yml).

### Configuration
> [!CAUTION]
> Do not modify `docker-compose.yml`. You will break things.

Create a file by the name of `.env` in the same directory as `docker-compose.yml`. Add the following.
```env
TITLE=
DESCRIPTION=
```

`TITLE` - The title to be used around PasteBook.

`DESCRIPTION` - The description to be used in embeds and on the home page of PasteBook.

### Creation
Run the following.
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Awesome! PasteBook is now running.

## Nginx Configuration
In order to run PasteBook under a domain, you will need to use a reverse proxy. The following will serve as a guide to setting up Nginx.

### Prerequisites
- PasteBook is fully installed with the instructions above.
- A working Nginx installation. Learn more [here](https://nginx.org/en/linux_packages.html#instructions).
- A working Certbot installation. Learn more [here](https://certbot.eff.org/instructions?ws=nginx&os=snap).
## Nginx Preparation
Navigate to `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled`.

## Domain Preparation
You will need to create a DNS A record pointing to your machine with the root and with the `api.` prefix. I use CloudFlare.

### Configuration 
Download `pastebook.conf` [here](https://github.com/Loudbooks/PasteBook/blob/master/pastebook.conf).

`<DOMAIN>` - Change this to your domain name. For example, mine is `pastebook.dev`.

### SSL Configuration
Run the following, with `<DOMAIN>` changed to your domain.
```bash
sudo certbot --nginx -d <DOMAIN> -d api.<DOMAIN>
```

### Committing Changes
Run the following.
```bash
systemctl restart nginx
```

# Updating PasteBook
Run the following commands in succession.
```bash
docker compose stop
docker compose up -d
```
