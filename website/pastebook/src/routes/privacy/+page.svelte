                review
                their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use, and share your personal information, and how

                outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</em></p>

                this
                privacy
                notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or
                other
                legal
                requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer

                period of time in which users have an account with us .</p>
            <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either
                delete
                or
                anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information
                has
                been
                stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from
                any
                further
                processing until deletion is possible.</p>
            <p><strong>7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</strong></p>
            <p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong> <em>We aim to protect your personal information through a system of
                organizational and technical security measures.</em></p>
            <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to
                protect
                the
                security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure
                your
                information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be
                guaranteed to
                be
                100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third
                parties
                will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your
                information.
                Although
                we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and
                from
                our
                Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>

                personal
                information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and
                take
                reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we
                may

            <p><strong>10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</strong></p>
            <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (&quot;DNT&quot;)
                feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online
                browsing
                activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and
                implementing
                DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other
                mechanism
                that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking
                is
                adopted
                that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this
                privacy
                notice.</p>
            <p>California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals. Because there
                currently
                is
                not
                an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this
                time.</p>

            <p>Under certain US state data protection laws, you can designate an authorized agent to make a request on
                your
                behalf.
                We may deny a request from an authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have been validly
                authorized
                to
                act on your behalf in accordance with applicable laws. </p>
            <p><strong>Request Verification</strong></p>
            <p>Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person

                whom
                we
                have the information in our system. We will only use personal information provided in your request to
                verify
                your
                identity or authority to make the request. However, if we cannot verify your identity from the
                information
                already

                your
                identity
                and for security or fraud-prevention purposes.</p>
            <p>If you submit the request through an authorized agent, we may need to collect additional information to
                verify
                your
                identity before processing your request and the agent will need to provide a written and signed
                permission
                from
                you
                to submit such request on your behalf.</p>
            <p><strong>Appeals</strong></p>
            <p>Under certain US state data protection laws, if we decline to take action regarding your request, you may
                appeal
                our
                decision by emailing us at contact@pastebook.dev. We will inform you in writing of any action taken or
                not
                taken
                in
                response to the appeal, including a written explanation of the reasons for the decisions. If your appeal
                is
                denied,
                you may submit a complaint to your state attorney general.</p>
